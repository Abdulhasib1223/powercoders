      3 carrots
      , thickly sliced, at an angle
      300g Brussels sprouts
      , trimmed and halved, if they’re large
      2 leeks

      <li>
        Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil,
        tip in the carrots and boil for 3 mins, then add the sprouts
        and boil for another minute before adding the leeks. Boil everything for 5 mins more,
        then drain well.

        Sizzle the butter in a large frying pan or sauté pan until it turns a nutty brown,
        then add the sage, if using. Let it crackle, then transfer to a plate, leaving the butter in the pan.
        Add some cracked black pepper to the butter, tip in the vegetables and
        gently stir-fry until the veg is piping hot and starting to brown around the edges.
        Season with sea salt and serve straightaway,
        with the sage scattered over, if using.
